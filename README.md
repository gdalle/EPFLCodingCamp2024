# EPFL Coding camp 2024

For this project, we will use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language within a [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebook environment.
To get started, follow these [installation instructions](https://plutojl.org/#install) and try launching your first notebook.

## Preparation

Whether or not you are familiar with programming, it would be great to get acquainted with basic Julia syntax before the week starts. Julia is very similar to Python but there are a few key differences, mostly related to the type system.

The following three lectures (courtesy of my friend Adrian Hill) start from zero and teach you all you need to know.
Keep in mind that these lectures are designed for university students: it's okay to skip a section if it sounds too advanced.

1. [Types, functions and multiple dispatch](https://adrianhill.de/julia-ml-course/L1_Basics_1/)
2. [Arrays and linear algebra](https://adrianhill.de/julia-ml-course/L2_Basics_2/)
3. [Custom types](https://adrianhill.de/julia-ml-course/L4_Basics_3/)

I encourage you to download and run the notebooks locally, so that you can experiment as you learn.
Once you're done with them, you should be able to solve the following [Pok√©mon-themed homework](https://mit-c25-fall22.netlify.app/homeworks/hw1a) without major trouble.

If you seek more opportunities to practice, there are Julia exercises on  [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/julia) and [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), for which you receive automated feedback.
And if you want to dive deeper into the language, check out the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) (but be careful, it is often much too detailed).

## Objective

Your goal for the week will be to tackle the Google Street View Routing challenge.
Please open the [challenge notebook](https://gdalle.github.io/EPFLCodingCamp2024) for a detailed description.
